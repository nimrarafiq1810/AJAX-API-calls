In this code, AJAX calls are implemented to fetch web API data in three different ways. 
First its with XMLHttp Request but its very old-school method not used these days.
Second with manual fetch and promise(.then()) method.
Third is the most useful Async/Await method along with error-handling.
Basically we integrate the API of data about countries. User enter the 3 country names then the information about flag, name, language, population and currency displays on the webpage.
